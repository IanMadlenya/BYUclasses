Cell[TextData[StyleBox["\tI read a study on the Returns to Scale in the US \
Post Office. The main problem that was addressed by the article was \
developing cost and derived demand functions ofr intra post office activities \
and assess whether it would be more effecient to consolidate, decentralize, \
or leave unchanged various operations.  The main method used by the team was \
in their words: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]demand equations were estimated \
econometrically through cross sectional observations of 156 offices\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] inputs, outputs, and factor prices.... a Cobb-Douglas \
hypothesis is maintained\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].\n\n\tThe findings of the \
research team were that over the 156 offices they evaluted there exists \
mainly decreasing returns to scale. To be honest that suprised me a bit.  The \
United States Postal Service has had a huge market share in the postal \
services sector for such a long time, I would that if it was ineffecient to \
be highly centralized, changes to the business model/structure would have \
been made already. (I am not sure if any of these changes have happened since \
the time the report and observations were put together, but it wouldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t suprise me if they have.)",
